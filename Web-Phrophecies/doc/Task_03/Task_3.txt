--> Web Shop Design with CSS

Task 3.1: Basic Design
> Decide how your Web shop pages should look like (colors, fonts, etc.). Specify all the necessary style information in the external CSS file. 
It is recommended to:
	> use class-attributes to group similar elements of your page,
	> assign id-attributes to access the elements in the CSS file.

------

Task 3.2: Content

> Add some additional pages to your site. Reuse the <div>-elements from the main HTML file (copy/paste). 
Link all pages to the same CSS file. Add links to the navigation menu (or elsewhere) to make all pages accessible from the main page (and vice versa).
Fill the pages with meaningful content. One of your pages should contain the list of products you offer (product number, description, price, etc.).
