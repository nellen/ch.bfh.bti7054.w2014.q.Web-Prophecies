(4) The Webshop goes PHP

Task 4.1: PHP Setup
> Make sure you have your PHP development environment setup as discussed above and run your own "helloWorld.php".

------

Task 4.2: Dynamic Navigation Menu
> Replace the HTML navigation menu in the main page of your Web site by PHP. For this, store the names of each menu item in an indexed array. 
Do the same for corresponding links, i.e., use another indexed array (alternatively, you may use a two-dimensional array for both). 
Write the necessary PHP code to transform the array contents into the "old" HTML navigation menu.

------

Task 4.3: List of Products
> Do the same for the list of products, i.e., put all the information (product name, price etc.) in one- or multi-dimensional arrays 
and write the PHP code to display it as HTML.
