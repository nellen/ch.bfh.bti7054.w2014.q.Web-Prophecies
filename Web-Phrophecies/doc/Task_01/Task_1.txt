Task 1.2: Web Shop Basics
▶ Work out a basic concept for your Web shop. The most important decision is about the type of products you want to sell (e.g. computers). 
Find something, which allows you to classify the products into a small number of main categories (e.g. desktop computers, servers, notebooks, PDAs). 
Some of the products should have additional options or extensions (e.g. 2GB/4GB RAM, 200/250GB HD). 
Work out a precise list of categories, products, options, and prices. The total number of different products should be about 20.
